# DSA_SNHU
**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
For this class I had to use a data structure to store the contents of a .csv file.  I also had to sort those contents within the data structure using an efficient sorting algorithm.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I created pseudocode to help me approach this problem.  It was a lot easier after breaking down the problem into byte size chunks.  I also had to consider the runtime of the sorting algorithm, given the data that needed sorting.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I used a lot of YouTube and Google to overcome roadblocks.  Most of the roadblocks were because of improper linking of the cpp files in my IDE.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
I will definately consider the runtime of algorithms in the future.  I also hadn't used binary trees and hash functions until this project.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I did pick up a couple of practices for commenting from this project.  However, I think adaptability was the thing I improved on the most.  I created my program so that I could easily swap out data structures and sorting algorithms within the code.
